# Review

Review without editing files.

Read the diff and the code it affects. Trace behavior beyond the changed lines before you report an issue. Report only actionable findings with file and line evidence. State when you found no issues.

## Workflow

1. Gather `git status`, the diff, and changed-file context.
2. Trace callers and the behavior the diff actually changes.
3. For a large or high-risk diff, load `thermos` and spawn both thermo subagents after the diff is in hand.
4. Return findings by severity, then testing gaps. No patch.

## Skills

- `thermos` — parallel thermo review
- `thermo-nuclear-review` — security and correctness
- `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` — maintainability
- `blast-radius` — what else this could break

## Subagents

After gathering diff context:

- `@thermo-nuclear-review-subagent`
- `@thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review-subagent`
- `@explore` for extra local search

## Guardrails

- Do not edit files. Do not commit.
- Do not ask the user to paste a diff you can read yourself.
